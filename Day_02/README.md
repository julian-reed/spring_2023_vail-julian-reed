# Deep Learning and TensorFlow

## Topics covered in today's module
* Linear models in machine learning
* Introduction to TensorFlow
* Dataloaders
* Building a simple Neural Network

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
How to build a neural network, step by step
Tensorflow, why it is useful, how to use it simply.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
I found the first fun fact about the amount of programming languages in the world (700+, wow!) really surprising and helpful to put into context just how many applications coding has in the world. Although it wasn't challenging as I was following already written code, it was valuable to get walked through the process of creating an ML model step by step.
