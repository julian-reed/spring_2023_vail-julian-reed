# Artificial Neural Networks

## Topics covered in today's module
* Introduction to Neural Networks
* Hyperparameters
* Forward Pass
* Backpropagation
* Computing accuracy

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
What the foward and backward pass functions are, how to create a simple nueral network.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
This module had a lot of math, particularly about matricies which I'm not super familiar with so that was difficult, but I'm happy to be getting into the nitty-gritty of ML.

## Additional resources used 
None.
