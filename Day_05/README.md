# Regression Loss Functions

## Topics covered in today's module
* Mean Squared Error
* Mean Absolute Error
* Mean Squared Logarithm Error

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
ALWAYS use numpy operations rather than normal operations, ex. normal absolute value or squaring. It seems obvious enough, but it tripped me up a bit. Also, the range of possibilities there are for calculating loss functions and what seem like the most common/easiest to understand ones

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
I found the fun fact really interesting. I remember back in middle school teachers could always tell when student would use google translate, now I understand why a little bit more!

## Additional resources used 
Keras documentation as linked in the module.
