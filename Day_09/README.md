# Overfitting and Underfitting

## Topics covered in today's module
* Overfitting
* Underfitting
* Data preparation
* Reducing network capacity

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
The main way to reduce overfitting is to reduce the complexity of the model
Cleaning a dataset requires careful consideration of each and every factor that might mess up the model and removing them
Bias-varience tradeoff: an underfit model would have high bias low varience, while an overfit model would be the opposite

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
Seeing how many steps it took to carefully clean and prepare the data for modelling was interesting and likely quite challenging if I had to do it myself.
Purposefully creating a model that overfit and underfit was helpful for getting a better understanding of what types of approaches lead to each outcome.
